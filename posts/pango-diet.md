Pangolins are insectivores that primarily feed on ants and termites. They have no teeth, so instead of chewing, they rely on their long, sticky tongues, sometimes longer than their own body in proportion, to collect insects from nests and tunnels. Their tongues are anchored deep in the chest cavity, allowing them to extend far to reach into narrow spaces. To break down their food, pangolins swallow small stones and sand that help grind the insects in a specially adapted, muscular stomach, functioning similarly to a bird's gizzard. Using their powerful claws, they tear into ant hills, termite mounds, and rotting logs to access their prey. Depending on the species, some pangolins forage on the ground while others specialize in finding insects in trees. Because of their specialized diet and feeding behavior, pangolins are notoriously difficult to care for in captivity, often refusing unfamiliar foods.
