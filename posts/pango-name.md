The genus name Manis come from the Latin word for ghost or  underworld, which may refer to their solitary, nocturnal habits. The African species have different genus names: Smutsia and Phataginus. Smuts is from the German term for "dirt," which is logical as the two species in this genus are referred to as ground pangolins. Phata is Latin for crack and likely refers to the cracked look of their scales. As for their common name, pangolin comes from the Malay word for pangolins, p?ngulin. This translates to roller, which describes their ability to roll into a tight ball.
