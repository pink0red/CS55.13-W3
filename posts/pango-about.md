 Pangolins are unique, scaled, nocturnal mammals found in Asia and Africa. They are known for their ability to curl into a ball when threatened, a defense mechanism against predators. All eight pangolin species are facing threats, primarily from habitat loss and illegal wildlife trade. They are the most trafficked mammal in the world, primarily for their meat and scales, which are used in traditional medicine.
